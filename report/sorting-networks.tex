\section{Sorting networks}

\subsection{Testing}
Since it can be quite hard to see from the code if a specific sorting networks
should work, testing them is quite important. So for all the implemented
sorting networks for inputs $>4$ there is a test for a reserse sorted list, and
for a number of runs on random inputs. Futhermore there is the possibility to
run a full permutation test, that is testing the sorting networks for all
possible permutations of inputs of that size, though this should be possible to
make in $O(2^n)$ instead of the current $O(n!)$ due to the Zero-one principle.
This permutation test has been run on all the implemented sorting networks up
to and including \ttt{nsort\_13()}
