\section{Ford Johnson}
When considering element comparison in sorting smaller sets of numbers the algorithm by Ford \& Johnson is a classical example\cite{fj59}. We have implemented an in-place version of this algorithm following the outline by Ford \& Johnson\cite{fj59}. We note that it has been shown that the Ford \& Johnson does not achieve optimum, but does however come rather close\cite{m79}. We further implemented a version of Ford \& Johnson, that is optimized with regards to code branching. To be more precise, we have optimized out most of the if statements, by incorporating them in the math instead. This has resulted in a branch optimized version of Ford \& Johnson, hereby denoted "FJ branch optimized".
